<p>Why does the UTTP exist? I don't know, but they're actually predators. More than to see the eye.</p>
<p>That's where the AUTTP exists. To stop the UTTP.</p>
<p>The UTTP literally comments on random persons YT Shorts.</p>
<p>They comment like a whole entire idiot like a 2 year old toddler. They're saying stuff like "L+MY CONTENT IS BETTER+I DIDNT ASK"</p>
<br>
<p>Wow! So cool to see the UTTP back in the 2025 era. I hate these people. So, the site is there.</p>
<p>You're free to copy this site.</p>
<br>
<h1>What's the UTTP doing?</h1>
<p>Don't even get me started. They groom like a predator, traffickers, and random stupid idiots.</p>
<p>They have a Discord server, also UTTP members servers. I won't list them, since it's stupid to do that.</p>
<p>I hate the UTTP. Literally, <b>can't they stop?</b> Let's make the AUTTP stronger than ever.</p>
<p>We shouldn't stop with the AUTTP mission. We must stop the UTTP. <i><b>I guess, just stop the UTTP! Now!</b></i></p>
<p>(chatlogs coming soon - source is from the OG AUTTP site.)</p>

> [!CAUTION]
> Reminder that the UTTP has come back stronger than 2024. In 2025, they're stronger than ever. You, as the user excercise caution of probably: either being stalked or/and being doxxed.
